## REST
REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style inspired by the Web. 
Most important is the concept of resources. You can think of a resource as a thing that the service itself knows about, like a Customer. The server creates different representations of this Customer on request. How a resource is shown externally is completely decoupled from how it is stored internally. A client might as JSON representation of a Customer, for example, even if it is stored in a completely different format. Once a client has a representation of this Customer, it can then make requests to change it, and the server may or may not comply with them.

#### REST and HTTP
HTTP itself defines some useful capabilities that play very well with the REST style. For example, the HTTP verbs (e.g., GET, POST, and PUT) already have well-understood menaing in the HTTP specification as to how they should work with resources. The REST architectural style actually tells us that methods should behave the same way on all resources, and the HTTP specification happens to define a bunch of methods we can use.
